In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player must shoot and
destroy the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens down, a new 
fleet appears. The new fleet moves faster than the previous one. 
If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, 
the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
